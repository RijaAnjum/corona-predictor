            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus. The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more
            severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding
            touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-left">How It Spreads</h3>
        <p class="text-left">
            Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It
            also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes,
            nose, or mouth.
